## Stack Sort Method

### Guide
- An example stack is created, and if you run the file the sort method will run (node stack-sort.js)

- the console.log's in the terminal will show the values of the originalStack's top Vale as well as the newly created Stack's top value for the duriation of the algorithm

- comments in the code explain what is happening and why as the values for the nodes adjust

- a print method was added so before/ after the sort method is run you can the order of the node values in the stack
